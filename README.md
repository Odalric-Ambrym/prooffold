This repository contains a tool for reading/studying mathematical proofs. It tries to solve two main issues of traditional proofs written in a book:
- the global organization of a proof in a textbook is often not very clear. This is due to the linearity of a textual proof. Here, the proof is displayed in panels, making an emphasis on the structure of the proof
- In a textbook, justifications of a statement often ends up "by Theorem 1.2.3, Lemma 42.4 and Corollary 8.8.4 and Equation 1". Here, by clicking on a statement, the arguments used to deduced that fact are highlighted (TO BE IMPLEMENTED).


# Writing proofs

Proofs are easy to be written. 

`Fact
Theorem
      {
        write the proof of the theorem
        with an amazing fact
        {
           proof of that amazing fact
        }
      }
      Fact`
