Prove that $\sqrt 2$ is irrational.
{
	Suppose that $\sqrt 2$ rational.
	$\sqrt 2 = \frac a b$ irreducible, for some integers $a$ and $b$.
	$2 = \frac {a^2} {b^2}$ [[*]]
	$2b^2 = a^2$
	So $a^2$ is even.
	So $a$ is even.    [[*]]
	{
		Suppose $a$ is odd.
		$a = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$
		$a^2 = 4k^2+4k+1$
		$a^2$ is odd
	}
	
	$a = 2k$ for some $k$
	$2b^2 = a^2$
	$2b^2 = 4k^2$
	$b^2 = 2k^2$
	$b^2$ is even

	$b$ is even [[*]]
	
	Contradiction by [[*]]
